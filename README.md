# Mastermind Game

Mastermind is a game built using Python and Pygame. The game is based on the classic board game of the same name, where players must guess the secret combination of colors to win.

## How to Play

1. At the start of the game, a random secret code consisting of 4 colors is generated. The colors can be repeated in the code.

2. The player must guess the secret code by selecting 4 colors from a color palette. The player can click on the color palette to select the desired colors.

3. After the player has made a guess, the game will provide feedback on how accurate the guess was. A black peg indicates that a color in the guess is correct and in the correct position, while a white peg indicates that a color in the guess is correct but in the wrong position.

4. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the secret code. The game ends when the player correctly guesses the secret code or runs out of attempts.
